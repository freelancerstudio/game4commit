How to contribute ?
===============

How is it different than other crowdfunding sites?
--------------------------------------------------
On Game4commit the fundraiser is not expected to do the actual work. His job is to collect funds and distribute them to the people who work on the project. He may for example reward commits on an open source project or pay a lobbyist.

Why?
----
The goal is give the initiative to the people, and not only to those who are able to achieve projects.

For example imagine you want a feature in an open source software but the developers don't care about it and you can't implement it yourself. You can start a project on Game4commit to make it happen. If you get enough funds you can pay someone to implement the feature. There are many freelance developers and companies who will be happy to do that for you.

Or imagine you favorite band has given up. You can raise funds to pay them to work on a new album.


How can I get paid to do the actual work?
-----------------------------------------
Check the policies of the projects. Fundraiser can chose to raise bounty or a specific percentage of the donated funds for specific tasks or assign a percentage of the fund for commits in case of a development. If unclear ask the fundraiser. Disputes should be resolved between the developer and the fundraiser.

How do I Push my Commits?
-------------------------
Getting write access to the "Master" of a project involves that the project maintainer provides access to you in Github. This type of access would only be given to people trusted by the maintainer. If you already have write access to the project, just push your commits to the default branch of the project as usual. Otherwise, you'll have to fork the project (i.e. Start your own project based on the supported project), make some changes and create a pull request to propose your changes. If your pull request is accepted (Merged), you'll receive one tip per commit. If the changes are simple enough, you can do them in your browser by editing the files on GitHub. Otherwise, you'll have to use Git to clone your fork, make some changes, commit them and push the commits to GitHub. You can find a lot of information about that on GitHub help and on the web.

Make Sure You Read the Project Charter & Tipping Policies Before Starting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project maintainers can refuse your commits for several reasons. It is important to read the "Charter" of the project on its GitHub page, which usually provides guidance on which commits and under what rules they would be accepted. For example, there are very strict rules for contributing to the official Gamerscoin project. A good way to ensure the maintainer is willing to merge your changes is to first create an issue explaining what you're going to do and ask if they would merge a pull request. Wait for an answer before starting.
